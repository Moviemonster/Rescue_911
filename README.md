# Rescue_911
This Repository contais my first real python programm I programmed with a fellow student.
We got the task to automate the flyth of a Tello Drone.
As a feature it also should generate a visual feetback of the virtuall Map.

Disclaimer: This code is not professional and could be optimised a lot.
