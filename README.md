# Rescue_911
This Repository contains the first real python program I programmed with a fellow student.
We got the task to automate the flight of a Tello Drone.
As a feature, it also should generate visual feedback on a virtual Map.

Disclaimer: 
This code is not professional and could be optimized a lot.
